      <h3> Intro </h3>
        <p> This section quickly summarizes some major Java concepts. Each section has a short introductory paragraph,
          followed by bullet points with what I believe to be the key ideas. It is assumed the reader is familiar with
          these concepts, as the purpose is to refresh the mind of the reader rather than teach them new material. </p>

          important keyword(s). Disable/Enable all the hidden words by tapping the button at the top right. </p>

      <h3> General </h3>
        <p> Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language, that is <span class="answer">statically</span> 
          scoped, and <span class="answer">statically</span> typed. </p>

        <h5> Java Platform </h5>
          <p> All programs written in the Java language rely on the set of predefined classes that comprise the Java 
            platform. Java classes are organized into related groups known as packages. The Java platform defines 
            packages for functionality such as input/output, networking, graphics, user-interface creation, security, 
            and much more. (Source page 2 java in a nutshell) </p>

      <h3 class="java-inline-header">Inheritance </h3><h5 class="java-inline-header"> (subclass) vs </h5> 
        <h3 class="java-inline-header">Polymorphism </h3> <h5 class="java-inline-header">(subtype)</h5>
        <p>Inheritance (<span class="answer">subclassing</span>) is the process where one class 
          acquires the properties (methods and instance variables) of another by <span class="terminology">extending
          </span> it. Polymorphism (<span class="answer">subtyping</span>) is the ability to use subtypes in place of 
          supertypes. Subclassing is both <span class="answer">inheritance</span> + <span class="answer"> subtyping 
          </span>. </p>

        <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> </p>
          <ul class="java-lists">
            <li>Allows for code reuse. </li>   
            <li>Can't get inheritance without <span class="answer">subtyping</span>. </li>
            <li><span class="answer">IS-A</span> Relationship. </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="chip example-chip"> Example </div>
          <p><span class="code-snippet">class Dog extends Animal</span> will acquire all methods and instance variables 
            of <span class="code-snippet">Animal</span>. <span class="code-snippet">Dog</span> <span class="answer">
            IS-A</span> <span class="code-snippet">Animal</span>. </p>

        <p><strong>Polymorphism</strong></p>
          <ul class="java-lists">
            <li>Literaly translate to <span class="answer">having many forms</span>.</li>
            <li>When you define a supertype for a group of classes, <strong> any subclass of that supertype can be 
              substituted where the supertype is expected</strong>.</li>
            <li>Can be considered a subclass.</li>
            <li>Allows for polymorphic arrays! </li>
            <li>Allows for polymorphic arguments and return types! </li>
          </ul>
          <div class="chip example-chip"> Example </div>
          <span id="note-aside">Note: Assuming classes Dog, Hamster, and arcticWolf extend Animal: </span>
          <pre class="prettyprint">Animal myAnimal = new Dog() || new Hamster() || new arcticWolf();</pre>

      <h3>Override vs Overload</h3>
        <p>Most people seem to confuse these two, but they have nothing in common. Overriding occurs when a class inherits
          a method, and there is a need for the method to perform differently, so the method is overriden, and it then uses
          the new method rather than the inherited one. Oerloading is having two or more methods with the same name that 
          take a different number of parameters, or different type(s) of paramaters. </p>

        <p><strong>Overriding </strong> </p>
          <ul class="java-lists">
            <li> When a derived class requires a <span class="answer">different definition</span> of an inherited method.</li>
            <li> <span class="answer">Arguments</span> and <span class="answer">return</span> must be the same. </li>
            <li> Method can't be less accessible.</li>
          </ul>
        <p><strong> Overloading </strong></p>
          <ul class="java-lists">
            <li>Same method name, but either different number of <span class="answer">arguments</span>, or 
              <span class="answer">different types of arguments</span>.</li>
            <li> Has nothing to do with inheritance or <span class="answer">polymorphism</span>.</li>
            <li> Just changing the return type will cause <span class="answer">an error</span> and is NOT overloading.</li>
          </ul>

      <h3> Big-O notation, and algorithm complexity </h3>
        <span id="note-aside">Note: UNDER CONSTRUCTION</span>
        <p>Big-O is what we use to derive how long an algorithm takes to run. Big-O is how quickly it grows relative to the
          input, as the input gets arbitrarily large. <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">Click here </a> for an excellent 
          resource that breaks down many sorting algorithms as well as data structure, heap and graph operations into best, 
          average and worst space and time complexity. </p>
