		<h1>Java </h1>
		<h2>Polymorphism (subtype) vs Inheritance(subclass)</h2>
		<p>subclass is <span class="answer">inheritance</span> + <span class="answer"> subtyping </span></p>
		<p><strong>Inheritance:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>can't get inheritance without subtyping</li>
			<li>Code reuse.</li>
			<li>IS-A Relationship.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Polymorphism:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>literaly translate to "having many forms"</li>
			<li>When you define a supertype for a group of classes, <strong> any subclass of that supertype can be 
				substituted where the supertype is expected</strong></li>
			<li>Can be considered a subclass. i.e. Animal myDog = new Dog() || new Cat()</li>
			<li>Allows for polymorphic arrays! </li>
			<li>Allows for polymorphic arguments and return types! </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Override vs Overload</h2>
		<p><strong>Overriding </strong>
		<ul>
			<li> is when a derived class requires a different definition of an inherited method</li>
			<li> Arguments must be the same, and return must be the same </li>
			<li> Method can't be less accessible </li>
		</ul>		
		<p><strong> Overloading </strong> is when you have the same method name, but have either different number of arguments, or different types of arguments </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Has nothing to do with inheritance or polymorphism</li>
			<li> just changing the return type will cause an error and is NOT overloading </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Big-O notation, and algorithm complexity </h2>
		<p>Big-O is what we use to derive how long an algorithm takes to run. Big-O is how quickly it grows relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large. </p>
		<p>DATA STRUCTURES: tree, arraylist, array, stack, dictionary, map (hashmap, hashtree), 

		<h2> Exceptions </h2>
		<p>If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception</p>
		<p>Checked Exceptions</p>
		<ul>
			<li>extend Exceptions for this </li>
			<li>Give us reliable checked documentation about which exceptions might be thrown, and therefore
				which exceptions definitely will not be thrown!</li>
			<li>if method has checked exception in signature, try catch is not necessary</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Unchecked Exceptions</p>
		<ul>
			<li>extend runtime exceptions for this</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
