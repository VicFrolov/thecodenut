    <h2> Intro </h2>
    <p> This section quickly summarizes some major Java concepts. Each section has a short introductory explanation,
      followed by bullet points with what I believe to be the key ideas. It is assumed the reader is familiar with
      these concepts, as the purpose is to refresh the mind of the reader rather than teach them new material.</p>

    <p> To help with remembering, some keywords will be hidden, you can simply click or tap the box to reveal the
      important keyword(s). e.g. There are <span class="answer">eight</span> bits in a byte. You can also
      disable/enable all the hidden words by tapping the button at the top right</p>

    <h2> General </h2>
    <p> Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language, that is <span class="answer">statically</span> 
      scoped, and <span class="answer">statically</span> typed. </p>

    <h4> Java Platform </h4>
    <p> All programs written in the Java language rely on the set of predefined classes that comprise the Java 
      platform. Java classes are organized into related groups known as packages. The Java platform defines 
      packages for functionality such as input/output, networking, graphics, user-interface creation, security, 
      and much more. (Source page 2 java in a nutshell) </p>

    <h2>Polymorphism (subtype) vs Inheritance (subclass)</h2>
    <p>Inheritance (<span class="answer">subclassing</span>) is the process where one class 
      acquires the properties (methods and instance variables) of another by <span class="terminology">extending
      </span> it. Polymorphism (<span class="answer">subtyping</span>) is the ability to use subtypes in place of 
      supertypes. Subclassing is both <span class="answer">inheritance</span> + <span class="answer"> subtyping 
      </span>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Inheritance</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows for code reuse.</li>   
      <li>Can't get inheritance without <span class="answer">subtyping</span>.</li>
      <li><span class="answer">IS-A</span> Relationship.</li>
      <li>e.g. <pre> class Dog extends Animal </pre> will acquire all methods and instance variables of 
        <pre>Animal. Dog</pre> <span class="terminology"> IS-A </span> <pre>Animal</pre>. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Polymorphism</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>literaly translate to "having many forms"</li>
      <li>When you define a supertype for a group of classes, <strong> any subclass of that supertype can be 
        substituted where the supertype is expected</strong></li>
      <li>Can be considered a subclass. i.e. Animal myDog = new Dog() || new Cat()</li>
      <li>Allows for polymorphic arrays! </li>
      <li>Allows for polymorphic arguments and return types! </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Override vs Overload</h2>
    <p><strong>Overriding </strong>
    <ul>
      <li> is when a derived class requires a different definition of an inherited method</li>
      <li> Arguments must be the same, and return must be the same </li>
      <li> Method can't be less accessible </li>
    </ul>   
    <p><strong> Overloading </strong> is when you have the same method name, but have either different number of arguments, or different types of arguments </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Has nothing to do with inheritance or polymorphism</li>
      <li> just changing the return type will cause an error and is NOT overloading </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Big-O notation, and algorithm complexity </h2>
    <p>Big-O is what we use to derive how long an algorithm takes to run. Big-O is how quickly it grows relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large. </p>
    <p>DATA STRUCTURES: tree, arraylist, array, stack, dictionary, map (hashmap, hashtree), 

    <h2> Exceptions </h2>
    <p>If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception</p>
    <p>Checked Exceptions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>extend Exceptions for this </li>
      <li>Give us reliable checked documentation about which exceptions might be thrown, and therefore
        which exceptions definitely will not be thrown!</li>
      <li>if method has checked exception in signature, try catch is not necessary</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unchecked Exceptions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>extend runtime exceptions for this</li>
    </ul>
